# Brain Tumor Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning techniques. Given the small and imbalanced dataset, this solution incorporates data augmentation and a lightweight CNN model to achieve accurate predictions while minimizing overfitting.

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** [Kaggle Brain MRI Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Composition:**
  - 155 images of tumorous (malignant) MRI scans.
  - 98 images of non-tumorous (benign) MRI scans.
- **Challenges:**
  - Small dataset size.
  - Imbalanced data distribution.

## Approach
1. **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to increase the dataset's variability.
2. **Modeling:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed and trained for binary classification.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** 
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score

## Tools & Technologies

# Brain Tumor Detection with Deep Learning

## Abstract
This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting brain tumors in MRI images. Due to the small size and imbalanced nature of the dataset, data augmentation techniques and a simplified CNN architecture are employed.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Brain MRI Dataset
- **Distribution:** 155 tumorous images, 98 non-tumorous images.
- **Key Challenges:**
  - Limited data availability.
  - Class imbalance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model Training:** Built a custom CNN to classify MRI images.
3. **Evaluation:** Used accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics.

## Tools Used
- Python (TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

## Future Directions
- Integrating transfer learning with pre-trained models.
- Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
